"""
Box Packer Program - Optimal Pallet Arrangement Calculator

This program arranges rectangular boxes into the most efficient pattern for a layer on a wooden pallet.
The program follows these key principles:
- Uses spatial 2D placement algorithms for optimal packing efficiency
- Boxes are positioned using actual coordinates and butted against each other
- Boxes can be rotated 90Â° for better space utilization
- Visual representation shows exact spatial positioning without artificial grid constraints

Features:
- Automatic optimization to find the maximum number of boxes that fit
- Manual mode to test specific box counts
- Interactive 2D graphical visualization with matplotlib
- True spatial positioning where boxes are pushed up and left against adjacent boxes
- Professional visualization with proper scaling and measurements
